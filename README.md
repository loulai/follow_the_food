Follow the food!
===
My parents are always asking me for restaurant recommendations, so I decided to answer them by creating a website.

This is a when-I-have-time project, so unfortunately it isn't worked on daily. But over time, I hope this website will become substantial and deployable as an actual food blog.

The project is a test driven Ruby on Rails application.
